# DIGI-VOTING
**Digi Voting** is a web-based online election system built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** in **VS Code**. It has separate **Admin** and **User** pages. Users verify their Voter ID to vote, while Admins manage voters, view results, and check winners. The system ensures secure, transparent, and efficient digital voting.
Project Description:

Digi Voting is a web-based online voting system designed to conduct secure and transparent elections digitally. The project is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in Visual Studio Code (VS Code), providing a user-friendly interface for both voters (users) and administrators (admins).

The system has two main modules — User and Admin, each with separate functionalities and pages.

1. User Module:

The User Page allows registered voters to log in and verify their Voter ID before participating in the election.

Once the voter’s identity is confirmed, they are granted access to the voting page.

Each voter can cast their vote only once, ensuring election integrity.

The user interface is designed to be simple and intuitive, making the voting process fast and accessible.

2. Admin Module:

The Admin Page is password-protected to prevent unauthorized access.

The admin can add new voters, modify existing voter details, or remove users if required.

Admins have access to real-time election results, including the ability to view the winner after voting concludes.

The admin interface provides tools for managing the election process and ensuring accurate vote counting.

Key Features:

✅ Secure login for both Admin and User.

✅ Voter ID verification for authentication.

✅ Admin-controlled user management (add, edit, delete voters).

✅ Real-time result tracking and winner display.

✅ Simple, responsive design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

✅ Fully implemented and tested in VS Code environment.

Conclusion:

The Digi Voting system demonstrates how digital platforms can simplify and secure the election process. By separating user and admin functionalities, it ensures both data security and ease of management. This project showcases essential concepts in web development, form validation, data handling, and UI/UX design, making it an excellent foundation for advanced online election systems.
